# Changelog

All notable changes to iNTERCEPT will be documented in this file.

## [2.33.79] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **ACARS and VDL2 could silently stop decoding on macOS.** On a Mac the decoder's output is read through a pseudo-terminal that rejected anything that wasn't valid UTF-8, so a single corrupt byte from radio noise or a damaged frame stopped the reader while acarsdec/dumpvdl2 carried on running, and no more messages appeared. Invalid bytes are now replaced, as they already were on Linux. (#376)

## [2.33.78] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- **Meshtastic node actions (#270).** The Nodes tab lists your own node first, then favourites, then the rest by last heard. Each node has a favourite star plus ignore and remove buttons. These change the connected device's own node list, so they match the official apps: favourites set in the phone app show here too, an ignored node's packets are dropped by the device (it stays in the list, dimmed, so it can be unignored), and a removed node comes back if it's heard again. Ignore and remove ask first. (#374)
- **Meshtastic message search, "Text only" and replies (#270).** The Messages tab has a "Find in conversation" search (text, sender name or ID) and a remembered "Text only" toggle that hides `[UNKNOWN]` and other non-text packets. A reply button on received messages sends a native Meshtastic reply, which the official apps show as a quote. It goes on the same channel, or straight to the sender for a direct message, and incoming replies show the message they answer. Replies are kept in message history. (#374)

### Fixed

- **ISS SSTV ignored the frequency you entered.** The frequency box looked editable, but the decoder snapped anything within 50 kHz back to 145.800 MHz and rejected everything else, so events on another downlink couldn't be received. It now tunes the frequency you enter, and Doppler correction follows it. Thanks @shaun-greenwood. (#371, #372)
- **Meshtastic messages held on the node showed the wrong time.** Messages waiting on the node when you connected were stamped with the time they reached the PC. They now use the time the radio heard them, in the feed and in stored history, and fall back to arrival time if the node has no clock. Thanks @bob1234uk. (#270, #372)
- **"Serial" was cut off in the Meshtastic connection dropdown.** The box now sizes to fit. (#270, #372)

## [2.33.77] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- **AIS on a HackRF could open the wrong SDR.** Since 2.33.76, AIS-catcher was started without the HackRF's serial number, so it opened the first SDR it found; with RTL-SDRs also connected, that could be an RTL dongle, possibly one another mode was using. AIS now looks up the selected HackRF's serial and passes it to AIS-catcher, and says clearly if the serial can't be read instead of starting on the wrong device. Asking for bias-T with AIS on a HackRF now logs a warning, since AIS-catcher can't enable it. (#369)

## [2.33.76] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- **The in-app updater said the latest version was v2.33.47.** It only asked GitHub for the latest *release*, and versions since v2.33.47 were published as tags without a release, so every install reported v2.33.47 (older than what it was running) and never offered an update. The updater now also reads the tags and uses the highest version, and ignores a saved "latest" older than the running version. Releases are also published on GitHub again, so older installs will see this update too. (#368, reported in #345)
- **AIS failed to start on a HackRF.** AIS-catcher was given a SoapySDR-style device string and RTL-SDR gain settings, so it printed its usage banner and exited. It now uses AIS-catcher's native HackRF support, selecting the device by serial and setting LNA/VGA gain. Bias-T isn't available for HackRF in AIS-catcher. Thanks @osungjinwoo. (#358)
- **Radiosonde with a HackRF selected failed with a misleading "device not available".** The page didn't send the SDR type, and `radiosonde_auto_rx` only supports RTL-SDR anyway. Starting Radiosonde with a non-RTL-SDR device now says so straight away, before claiming the device. Thanks @osungjinwoo. (#358)

## [2.33.75] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **HackRF became the default device everywhere.** Detected SDRs were sorted alphabetically by type, and "hackrf" sorts before "rtlsdr", so with a HackRF plugged in every mode and dashboard defaulted to it (the ADS-B dashboard then warned that readsb was required). RTL-SDRs are now listed first. The ADS-B dashboard's "readsb required" warning now only appears when there is no RTL-SDR to use instead.
- **Nav icons missing on the dashboards.** The mode icons in the nav's group buttons and dropdown menus are sized by `core/components.css`, which only the main page loads, so on the ADS-B, AIS, satellite, APRS and mesh dashboards they rendered at 0×0 — once the group labels hid below 1400 px, only the dropdown carets were left. The icons are now sized in `core/layout.css`, which every page loads.
- **Meteor Scatter did nothing on a HackRF.** HackRF I/Q capture used SoapySDR's `rx_sdr`; on installs without it the server replied "rx_sdr not found" and the page only logged it to the console. Meteor Scatter and Waterfall now fall back to `hackrf_transfer` (signed 8-bit I/Q, with its once-a-second stderr status drained so the capture can't stall), and Meteor Scatter shows start errors instead of silently doing nothing. Verified on a HackRF One: ~19.5 waterfall frames/s at 2 MS/s.

## [2.33.74] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- **LoRa menu.** Meshtastic and Meshcore move out of Wireless into their own LoRa group, in the desktop nav, the mobile nav and the welcome screen's mode catalog.

### Fixed

- **Nav bar still unusable in narrow windows on some desktops.** The 2.33.73 fix only applied when the browser reported a mouse as its *primary* pointer (`pointer: fine`); touchscreen laptops and some Linux setups report touch, so they still got the unscrollable swipe strip. It now applies whenever any mouse or trackpad is present (`any-pointer: fine`).
- **Desktop nav fits at every width with seven groups.** The extra group pushed tool buttons off-screen again at 1024 px, 1301–1400 px and 1421–1600 px. Group labels now show from 1400 px (icon-only below, with tighter padding so the row fits at 1024 px), and the More/Kill All/dashboard labels from 1620 px. The icon-only padding rule is scoped under `.mode-nav` so the duplicate rule in `index.css` no longer overrides it.

## [2.33.73] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Meshcore node search (#270).** The Nodes list on the Meshcore dashboard has a search box (name or node ID, with a match count). Clicking a node opens the Map tab centred on it, or says "no position" if it hasn't reported one; a Msg button picks it as the message recipient and jumps to the compose box.

### Fixed

- **Nav bar unusable in narrow desktop windows.** Below 768 px wide the nav becomes the phone layout's single swipe-to-scroll strip with a hidden scrollbar; with a mouse it couldn't be scrolled, so most modes and all the tool buttons (settings, help, Kill All) were out of reach — easy to hit with a half-width window on a scaled display. With a mouse or trackpad it now wraps into rows; touch screens keep the swipe strip.
- **SubGHz transmit confirmation hidden under the mobile nav.** Same cause as the capture inspector fixed in 2.33.71 (`.main-content`'s `backdrop-filter` pinning the fixed overlay to that box); the dialog now opens over the whole screen.

## [2.33.72] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **Meshtastic message history is kept (#270).** Received messages are now saved to the database instead of only an in-memory list, so the dashboard shows past conversations as soon as it opens — before you reconnect — and after server restarts. `/meshtastic/messages` returns the most recent 500 stored messages (falling back to the current session if the database is unavailable). A packet heard twice (mesh rebroadcast, Store & Forward replay) is stored and shown once. Messages older than 90 days are cleaned up daily.
- **Store & Forward is reachable again.** A "Missed" button on the Messages tab (shown while connected) opens the existing Store & Forward dialog, which asks a router node on the mesh for messages sent before you connected. The dialog's Retry action also called a function that doesn't exist; it now retries the request.

## [2.33.71] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- **SubGHz capture inspector.** A new Inspect button on each saved capture opens a pulse-level view of one burst: an amplitude envelope you can zoom to individual pulses, and rtl_433's pulse analysis of it — pulse and gap widths, a modulation guess, RSSI/SNR, the sliced bits in hex and binary, and a suggested flex decoder. For PWM, PPM and Manchester signals, "Decode live in OOK mode" switches to the OOK decoder with the frequency, encoding and timings filled in. Captures at any HackRF sample rate are reduced to 1 MS/s for analysis; windows longer than 2 s are cut to 2 s. Served by `GET /subghz/captures/<id>/inspect?burst=N`; needs `rtl_433`.

## [2.33.70] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **HF SSTV now decodes on sideband.** The SSTV decoder defaulted to 14.230 MHz with FM selected, so unless a preset was picked it FM-demodulated an upper-sideband signal into noise. USB is now the default, and typing a frequency that matches a preset applies that preset's modulation (sideband on HF, FM on VHF/UHF).
- **SSTV works when the receiver is not tuned exactly.** On SSB every tone arrives shifted by the tuning error, and the VIS header detector only recognised headers within about ±30 Hz of exact tuning — tens to a couple of hundred Hz off is normal on HF. The detector now measures the leader tone's frequency to find the offset (up to ±250 Hz; verified end to end to ±200 Hz), reads the rest of the header at the shifted tones, and the image decoder removes the same offset from sync detection and pixel brightness. A preamble tone before the leader no longer throws the header detection off.
- **SSTV images no longer tear partway down in noise.** After the first line the decoder searched up to 10% of a line ahead for each sync pulse, so a noise burst could pull it forward and shift every later line sideways. Once locked it now searches within about 1 ms. On a synthetic Martin1 image at 15 dB SNR the mean pixel error fell from about 58 to 16 (out of 255).

## [2.33.69] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **SubGHz Frequency Analyzer no longer hangs the page.** `hackrf_sweep` writes about 1,250 lines a second over the default 300–928 MHz range, and each line was sent to the browser as its own event and redrawn in full, freezing the page for seconds at a time. The server now merges sweep output into about eight updates a second, and the chart merges points through a frequency index and redraws at most once per frame. Measured on a Pi with a HackRF One: 226 → 7 events/s, 2.5 → 23 frames/s.
- **SubGHz Frequency Analyzer is sharp and readable.** The chart now renders at the display's pixel density (it was blurry on scaled screens), draws the strongest bin per pixel column instead of a zig-zag through ~6,300 bins, smooths the trace across sweeps (fast rise, slow fall, so short bursts still show), and keeps the trace inside the axes.
- **No more "Unhandled Error: Unknown error" pop-ups.** Resizing the window with the SubGHz Frequency Analyzer open set off a harmless browser "ResizeObserver loop" warning, and the global error handler showed each one as "Unknown error": it ignored only Chrome's old wording of that warning, and ignored the browser's message whenever no error object came with it. The handler now filters both wordings and falls back to the browser's message, and the chart canvas no longer resizes its own container, which ended the loop.
- **Nav bar no longer loses its tool buttons between 1024 and 1300 px wide.** Settings, help, alerts, "more" and stop-all were pushed off the right edge; in that range the six group buttons now show their icon only.

## [2.33.68] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **SubGHz ↔ TSCM RF sweep no longer collide on the SDR (#345).** The SubGHz sweep and the TSCM RF scan drive the same HackRF but didn’t coordinate, so leaving one running made the other fail to open the device (hackrf_open() -5). Each now refuses to start with a clear message when the other is holding the SDR, instead of colliding.
- **SubGHz status no longer reports a stale HackRF connection (#345).** The HackRF-detected cache is now cleared when a sweep ends, so `/subghz/status` re-probes after the device drops out rather than reporting a stale “connected”.

## [2.33.67] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- **TSCM RF scan: surface real sweep errors and stop early (#345).** The counter-surveillance RF scan only logged a failing `hackrf_sweep`/`rtl_power` server-side, so a device that couldn’t be opened produced “rf_count: 0” run after run with no visible reason while it churned through all seven bands. It now emits the tool’s real error to the UI (e.g. “hackrf_open() failed: HackRF not found (-5)”) and stops after two consecutive band failures instead of running the whole sweep — matching the SubGHz sweep hardening in 2.33.63.

## [2.33.66] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- **Internal:** restored CRLF line endings on four SDR command-builder files (hackrf, limesdr, sdrplay, airspy) that a scripted edit in 2.33.65 had flattened to LF. No functional change.

## [2.33.65] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **ADS-B with HackRF / SoapySDR now starts (#346).** The readsb command builders passed `--device-type soapysdr`, but readsb’s value is `soapy` — so readsb exited immediately and ADS-B never started on HackRF (and other SoapySDR devices). Corrected across all builders (HackRF, LimeSDR, SDRplay, Airspy, USRP, BladeRF, HydraSDR).

## [2.33.64] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **ADS-B: airband popover was clipped and appeared to do nothing.** The compact airband chip toggled but its popover opened upward into the bottom controls bar, which clips overflow — so only the caret flipped. The popover is now positioned with `position: fixed` above the chip (clamped to the viewport), so it actually shows.

## [2.33.63] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **SubGHz sweep: surface real errors and stop the restart storm (#345).** `hackrf_sweep` had its stderr sent to /dev/null (hence generic “Unknown error”) and would auto-restart up to 600 times even when it exited instantly. It now captures stderr and, if the tool keeps exiting within a few seconds, stops after 3 attempts and reports the actual error — while still auto-recovering from genuine mid-sweep USB drops.

## [2.33.62] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **Weather Satellite: HackRF / Airspy / SDRplay now work (#347).** The mode hard-rejected everything except RTL-SDR even though SatDump supports other sources. It now maps the selected SDR type to SatDump’s native `--source` (rtlsdr, hackrf, airspy, airspyhf, sdrplay) and only rejects types SatDump can’t drive directly, with a clearer message listing what’s supported.

## [2.33.61] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **AIS / VHF DSC: HackRF (and other non-RTL-SDR) now start correctly (#348).** The AIS and DSC dashboards never sent an `sdr_type` in their start requests, so the backend defaulted to `rtlsdr` and ran the RTL-SDR-only USB probe against a HackRF — failing with a misleading “device not available”. The dashboards now tag each device with its SDR type and include it in the start payload.

## [2.33.60] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- **ADS-B: airband controls are now a compact chip + popover.** The airband block sprawled across the bottom bar and reflowed messily at smaller widths. It’s now a small “Airband” chip (with a live status dot and the current frequency) that opens a tidy popover holding the frequency, SDR, squelch/volume, LISTEN and signal meter — clean at every screen size.

## [2.33.59] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **ADS-B: Enhanced Mode-S cockpit data.** When dump1090 supports it, INTERCEPT now reads its `aircraft.json` to enrich tracked aircraft with Comm-B / Enhanced Mode-S fields — roll (bank), magnetic heading, indicated airspeed, true airspeed, Mach, and autopilot selected altitude. The instrument panel uses them automatically: the airspeed gauge switches to IAS, the compass to magnetic heading, the turn instrument shows real bank angle, the altimeter shows the selected-altitude bug, and an “Enhanced Mode-S” section lists IAS/TAS/Mach/heading/bank/selected-altitude. Feature-detected (`--write-json`), so builds without it are unaffected; fields appear opportunistically as Comm-B replies are received.

## [2.33.58] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **ADS-B: pop-out instrument panel.** Select an aircraft and click “Instruments” to open a glass-cockpit pop-out window driven by the live feed — airspeed (ground speed), altimeter, vertical-speed and track gauges, a derived turn indicator, and a flight-data block, all as SVG instruments. Data is from ADS-B (SBS): ground speed and track (not IAS/heading); pitch/roll, IAS/Mach and autopilot selected altitude would require Enhanced Mode-S (a planned follow-up).

## [2.33.57] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **ISS dashboard: relayed stations plotted on the map.** When the ISS APRS receiver hears a digipeated packet that carries a position, the ground station is now plotted on the ISS map (amber marker, callsign + message on hover) in addition to the packet list — a self-contained “who did the ISS just relay” view. Markers clear when the receiver is stopped.

## [2.33.56] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **ISS dashboard: the ISS map marker is now visible.** It used a satellite emoji, which doesn’t render on many Linux systems (no colour-emoji font), so nothing showed at the station’s position. Replaced with an inline SVG satellite icon (gold body, blue arrays) with the pulsing glow, and removed Leaflet’s default white marker box.

## [2.33.55] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **ISS dashboard visual polish.** The header title now uses the Orbitron display font with a cyan underline (it was falling back to plain text, since the shared dashboard chrome has no header styling), the layout is a proper full-height flex column so the telemetry panel is no longer pushed off-screen, and the station graphic is redesigned: a detailed ISS schematic (truss, modules, radiators, Sun) whose eight solar wings rotate to their real angles and glow when the station is sunlit, a pulsing map marker, and Orbitron panel titles with glow accents throughout.

- **ISS dashboard: nav dropdowns no longer hide behind the map.** The nav menu z-index (100) sat below Leaflet's map panes/controls; lifted the nav above the map.

### Added

- **ISS dashboard: ISS-relayed APRS (145.825 MHz).** A new panel receives APRS packets digipeated by the ISS using the existing direwolf-based receiver — one click starts the receiver on 145.825 MHz and lists packets as they arrive, highlighting those relayed via the ISS (RS0ISS/ARISS). Needs an SDR + VHF antenna and works best during a pass.

## [2.33.54] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- **ISS dashboard (`/satellite/iss`).** A live International Space Station tracker: real-time sub-point, altitude and orbital velocity, a ±45-minute ground track, visibility footprint, a day/night terminator with a sunlight indicator, observer look-angles (elevation/azimuth/range) and the next passes over your location. All computed locally from the ISS TLE via skyfield, so it works with no external feed. Reachable from the nav (“ISS Live”).

- **ISS dashboard: live NASA telemetry.** A server-side bridge to NASA’s public Lightstreamer feed (`ISSLIVE`) streams live station telemetry into the dashboard: the solar-array schematic rotates its eight panels to their real Beta-Gimbal angles, and a readout grid shows cabin pressure, ppO₂/ppCO₂, SARJ angles and attitude rate. One upstream connection for the whole process, and an honest **AOS / LOS** state — when the station is in Loss of Signal the panel says so and freezes rather than showing stale numbers.

## [2.33.53] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **ADS-B: clicking a plane on the map now plays the focus-in crosshair animation.** The crosshair fly-to only fired when selecting an aircraft from the side list; clicking a marker on the map (or a linked ACARS/VDL2 message) did a plain recenter. All selection sources now use the same crosshair focus animation.

## [2.33.52] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **Only one RTL-SDR detected when two are connected.** RTL-SDR detection stopped reading `rtl_test` output the moment the first device line appeared and immediately SIGINT'd the process. Because `rtl_test` opens each dongle to read its USB strings (~50-100ms apart), it was interrupted mid-enumeration and every device after the first was dropped. Detection now reads until all announced devices have arrived (or the benchmark loop starts), so multiple dongles are found. Regression from the SDR-lockup fix in 2.33.46.

## [2.33.51] - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- **Consistent monospace for data fields.** Introduced a dedicated `--font-data` token (JetBrains Mono, defined once in `core/variables.css`) for content where character alignment and 0/O/1/l disambiguation matter — MAC/BSSID, ICAO hex, MMSI, coordinates, IDs/UUIDs, RSSI/SNR, timestamps, counts, raw packets/hex dumps, TLE, and `code`/`kbd`/`pre`. 168 data rules across the SPA and dashboards (plus the spots hardcoded in 2.33.49–50) now use it. `--font-mono` is unchanged and still drives the condensed-sans look for labels, buttons, and chrome, so those are untouched.

## [2.33.50] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- **More monospace fallbacks.** A few more MAC/number/coordinate displays used the bare `monospace` keyword and rendered in a serif fallback on some systems; they now use the bundled JetBrains Mono: the satellite TLE input box, the APRS meter readout, the proximity-heatmap RSSI labels, and the APRS dashboard map popups (callsign/position).

## [2.33.49] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **WiFi: Deep Scan tab was unresponsive.** The Signal Source “Deep Scan” tab carried its colours as inline styles, which overrode the `.active` class the click handler toggled — so clicking it changed the mode internally but nothing moved on screen. The handler now updates the inline styling directly.
- **WiFi: proximity radar blips are now clickable.** Each blip carries the network’s BSSID and a hover tooltip (name, BSSID, channel, RSSI); clicking one selects that network (with a highlight ring) exactly like clicking a list row.
- **MAC/BSSID font.** WiFi client MACs and network BSSIDs, and the Bluetooth device address and modal values, were rendering in a proportional/serif fallback (the SPA remaps `--font-mono` to a condensed sans, and some rules used the bare `monospace` keyword). They now use the bundled JetBrains Mono.

### Added

- **WiFi: pick a deauth target from a list.** Attack Options now has a “Target BSSID” dropdown populated from scanned networks (strongest first), so you can select a target instead of pasting a BSSID; the manual entry field remains for off-list targets. For authorized testing.

## [2.33.48] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- **WiFi: guided handshake capture + export.** During an active handshake capture you can now click “Force handshake (deauth clients)” to nudge associated clients into reconnecting so a handshake is produced (confirmation-gated; authorized testing only). Once a valid handshake is captured, the panel offers one-click export as a hashcat `hc22000` file (via hcxpcapngtool) or the raw `.cap`. UI wiring plus a `/wifi/handshake/export` download endpoint over the existing capture handlers.

## [2.33.47] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- **WiFi: one-click capture/deauth.** The network detail panel now has Capture Handshake / Locate / Deauth actions that operate on the selected network, filling in the BSSID and channel automatically \u2014 no more pasting a BSSID into a text box to start a handshake capture. Reuses the existing capture/deauth handlers (UI wiring only). For authorized testing.

## [2.33.46] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **SDR hardware lockups / USB contention (#256).** Device probing and process shutdown now terminate decoders gently (SIGINT/SIGTERM with a SIGKILL fallback) instead of an abrupt `kill -9`, so librtlsdr can release USB endpoints cleanly; the detection cache TTL was raised (fewer USB bus scans) and re-probing is skipped while a device is actively streaming. Community contribution by @Dr-gigabyte.

## [2.33.45] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- **Space weather: clearer offline/unreachable states.** When the server can\u2019t reach the upstream sources (NOAA/HamQSL \u2014 e.g. a DNS failure), the flare-probability and X-ray panels now say the source is unreachable (with a check-network/DNS hint) and a banner appears, instead of misleading \u201cNo flare data\u201d/blank panels. The data path is unchanged; the outage itself is environmental.

## [2.33.44] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **Section/title fonts (Orbitron) were falling back to monospace.** Orbitron is used for dashboard and section titles across the satellite/ADS-B dashboards and the SPA but was never bundled or requested, so it fell back to a generic monospace and looked out of place. It is now bundled in `fonts-local.css` (offline) and requested on the SPA online path.
- **APRS dashboard map not loading.** The APRS dashboard was missing `settings-manager.js`, so the map could not apply the configured tile provider and stayed on the fallback grid. It now loads the tiles like the other dashboards (a test guards the dependency).
- **Space weather duplicate loading spinner.** The flare-probability and related loading placeholders showed two spinners because they carried both the `sw-loading` and `ui-loading` classes; the redundant one was removed.

## [2.33.43] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- **Meshtastic: message a node from the Nodes tab (#270).** Each node row now has a message action that drops the node\u2019s id into the compose box and switches to Messages, so you can direct-message any node \u2014 including ones with no GPS position that only appear in the list.

## [2.33.42] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- **Meshtastic dashboard: searchable Nodes tab (#270).** A new Nodes tab (between Messages and Channels) lists every node the device knows \u2014 including the many that report no position and so never appeared on the map \u2014 with name, id, SNR, battery and last-heard. Search by name or id, and click a node to centre the map on it (or see a note if it has no position).

## [2.33.41] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **Meshtastic/Meshcore dashboards broke after the dashboard migration (#270).** The standalone dashboards did not load some core scripts the mesh modules rely on, so the map was stuck on the default tiles (prompting for an API key) and, after a device connected, no nodes or messages rendered (an unguarded `CopyId`/`DeviceNotes` call threw). The dashboards now load `settings-manager.js` (both) and `copy-id.js` + `device-notes.js` (Meshtastic), and a test guards the includes.

## [2.33.40] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **ADS-B dashboard: aircraft tooltip no longer disappears on updates.** The hover tooltip was rebuilt whenever its text changed, closing it on every position/altitude update. It now updates in place, so it stays open and refreshes its numbers while you hover.
- **Installer: meshtastic packaging conflict.** Require `meshtastic>=2.7.9` (2.7.7/2.7.8 capped `packaging<25.0`, which pip flagged as conflicting with modern packaging). The warning was cosmetic and installs still worked; this keeps the resolver off the capped releases.

## [2.33.39] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **ADS-B \u2192 airband audio (#271).** Selecting an aircraft now shows a "Tune ATC" button that finds the nearest airport to the aircraft\u2019s position and loads its tower/approach/ATIS frequency into the airband receiver, then starts listening. Backed by a bundled OurAirports (public-domain) frequency dataset and a new `/adsb/nearest-airband` lookup. (Nearest-airport tower/approach only; enroute/centre frequencies are out of scope.)

## [2.33.38] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **ADS-B dashboard \u2014 range limit and configurable retention (#313).** A new "In range" toggle shows only aircraft within the selected range-ring distance of the observer, and a "Keep" selector sets how long aircraft with no fresh updates remain (30s / 1m / 2m / 5m / 10m / 15m, default 1m). This tames busy remote/aggregated feeds (e.g. FR24 via a remote agent) that could flood the map with hundreds of aircraft and lock up the browser. Both settings are per-browser and default to the previous behaviour.

## [2.33.37] - 2026-09-26

Housekeeping.

### Changed

- **Shared dashboard `<head>`.** The APRS/Meshtastic/Meshcore dashboards now pull their common `<head>` (meta, fonts, core CSS, globals, leaflet) from `templates/partials/dashboard_head.html` instead of repeating it. No behaviour change.
- **Docs.** `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect the completed dashboard migration (correct mesh route filenames; dashboards, routes and `dashboard-shell.css` documented).
- **Consistency.** Fixed the satellite dashboard browser-tab title casing to match the other dashboards.

## [2.33.36] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- **Meshtastic dashboard layout.** Reworked into a map + tabbed side panel (Messages / Channels / Info) with the node map always visible, closing the earlier layout gap and matching the Meshcore dashboard. Presentation-only; the module and its element ids are unchanged.
- **Accessibility (map dashboards).** Added a shared keyboard focus ring and aria-labels for the selects and inputs that lacked a visible label on the APRS, Meshtastic and Meshcore dashboards.
- **Internal.** The APRS/Meshtastic/Meshcore dashboards now share their page chrome (background, scan line, header controls) via a single `dashboard-shell.css` instead of duplicating it.

## [2.33.35] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Meshcore dashboard.** Meshcore moves out of the main-page SPA to a dedicated `/meshcore/dashboard` page: the mesh console (connection bar, transports, messages/compose), the node/contacts panel and the Messages/Map/Repeaters/Telemetry tabs, on a full-height layout. The Meshcore nav buttons (desktop and mobile) now open the dashboard directly. This completes the migration of the map-centric modes (ADS-B, AIS, satellite, APRS, Meshtastic, Meshcore) to dedicated dashboards.

### Removed

- The Meshcore mode from the main-page SPA (its inline panel and mode-registry entry), now that it lives on its own dashboard.

## [2.33.34] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **Meshtastic dashboard.** Meshtastic moves out of the main-page SPA to a dedicated `/meshtastic/dashboard` page: the mesh console (connection bar, live message feed and compose), the node map, the channels panel and the channel/traceroute tools, on a full-height layout. The Meshtastic nav buttons (desktop and mobile) now open the dashboard directly. Same client, endpoints and features as before.

### Removed

- The Meshtastic mode from the main-page SPA (its inline panel, mode partial and mode-registry entry), now that it lives on its own dashboard.

## [2.33.33] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- **APRS dashboard.** APRS moves out of the main-page SPA to a dedicated `/aprs/dashboard` page, matching the Aircraft and Vessels dashboards: a full-height Leaflet map with station markers, a filterable station list, a live packet log and a signal meter, plus the agent selector for remote sources. The APRS nav buttons (desktop and mobile) now open the dashboard directly. Same decoder and endpoints as before; the map/marker/stream logic is unchanged.

### Removed

- The APRS mode from the main-page SPA (its inline panel, `aprs-spa.js` and mode-registry entry), now that it lives on its own dashboard.

## [2.33.32] - 2026-09-26

Under the hood; finishes the main page code split.

### Changed

- **Main page code split (final round):** the last large inline `<script>` in index.html — the mode-switch core, SDR device handling, pager, and APRS — moves into four files under static/js/modes/ (core-mode-switch.js, sdr-device.js, pager.js, aprs-spa.js), loaded in the same order as before. index.html goes from 7,643 to 4,014 lines and is now almost entirely markup plus linked scripts. Content moved unchanged (only de-indented; verified byte-for-byte against the original block). Two template-embedded values (the initial device list and the satellite-dashboard version fallback) now read from window.INTERCEPT_INITIAL_DEVICES / window.INTERCEPT_VERSION. No behaviour change; verified by the browser smoke test.

## [2.33.31] - 2026-09-25

Mostly under the hood.

### Changed

- **Main page code split** (continuing last round's TSCM move): satellite/GPS/drone, device intelligence, Wi-Fi, and the 433 MHz/meter feed handling each move to their own file in static/js/modes/. index.html goes from 16,579 lines (before the split began) to 7,640. No behaviour change; verified by the browser smoke test and by checking every control's handler still resolves.
- **datetime.utcnow()** (deprecated) replaced everywhere with a timezone-aware call that yields the same value; timestamp output is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Theme sync across devices called routes that did not exist, so it 404'd on every page load and the theme only ever saved in one browser. A /settings/theme route now backs it.

---

## [2.33.30] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- **Map labels**: aircraft show callsign and flight level (GND on the ground), ships their name and speed. Shown only when zoomed in (zoom 8 for aircraft, 11 for ships); where two overlap the less important one hides. A "Labels" switch on each dashboard turns them off.
- **Ships to scale**: zoomed in far enough, a ship is drawn to its real size and shape, placed around its GPS antenna and turned to its heading. The server now keeps the antenna's offsets from bow, stern, port and starboard.
- **Ships at anchor or moored** are a dot, with no heading line.

### Fixed

- With the idle modes shown, the header's mode chips wrapped into rows that slid under the nav bar; they now stay on one line and scroll sideways.

---

## [2.33.29] - 2026-09-25

Map icons, and fixes.

### Changed

- **Aircraft icons**: new top-down silhouettes per type (airliner, widebody, business jet, turboprop, light aircraft, helicopter, military, glider) with a thin dark outline instead of a glow, so they read over satellite imagery. Military aircraft are a lighter khaki on the map.
- **Heading lines**: each moving aircraft shows where it will be in a minute; each moving ship where it will be in six minutes.
- **Status on the map**: aircraft on the ground are smaller and grey; emergency squawks (7500/7600/7700) are red with a pulsing ring; aircraft not heard for 20 s, and ships for 3 minutes, fade.
- **ADS-B** reads the "on ground" flag from the SBS feed.
- **Ship markers** get the same dark outline.

### Fixed

- Satellite Command: the map's clock covered the Decoded Packets panel, and the grid button covered the track card.
- On a slow device or connection, a mode whose script took over 5 s to load failed to start ("MeshCore is not defined"); it now starts when the script arrives.

---

## [2.33.28] - 2026-09-25

Polish round 7.

### Changed

- **3D globes work offline**: globe.gl is bundled (static/vendor/globe) for the WebSDR, System Health and GPS globes, instead of loaded from a CDN.
- **Native controls match the theme** (number spinners, date pickers, dropdown lists).
- **Settings**: Reset layout (Display tab) forgets opened sections and chosen views, keeping settings and location; the Location tab shows the saved location on one line instead of a second copy.
- **Smoke test** runs in the dark and light themes at desktop and phone size, and fails on missing static files and on screens that scroll sideways on a phone.
- **TSCM's code** moved out of index.html into static/js/modes/tscm.js (first stage of splitting the main page's script).

### Fixed

- The notification count on the bell was cut off by the toolbar.
- The network monitor scrolled sideways on a phone.

---

## [2.33.27] - 2026-09-25

Polish round 6.

### Changed

- **Browser smoke test** (`tests/smoke`, its own CI job): opens the main page in every mode and each dashboard in headless Chromium, and fails on an uncaught JavaScript error or a caught-and-logged TypeError/ReferenceError. Run with `pytest tests/smoke` (needs Playwright).
- **Inline colours**: 59 text colours and 13 panel backgrounds in the main page's inline styles now use the theme's colours, so they suit the light theme.
- **Bluetooth**'s missing-dependency note matches the other modes' "Needs …" note.
- **Settings**: install commands on the Tools tab are shown in full and selectable; the window keeps one height across tabs; checkboxes, radios and sliders use the accent colour on every page.
- **Quick Setup**: each check's status is a pill (amber pending, green done).
- **Wi-Fi**: the channel heatmap says when recent scans found nothing on channels 1–11, instead of drawing tall black columns.
- **Bluetooth**: Tracker Detection's empty state is centred and says what will appear.

---

## [2.33.26] - 2026-09-25

Polish round 5.

### Changed

- **Missing tools, said up front**: welcome tiles for modes whose decoder is not installed say what they need, and the mode's sidebar status card shows it with this system's install command, before you press Start (Pager, 433 MHz, aircraft, vessels, APRS, Bluetooth, radiosonde, SubGHz).
- **Header**: the mode badge (a third copy of the mode's name) and the Refresh and Tools buttons are gone; on a phone the header is a row shorter.
- **Dashboards in the light theme**: ADS-B, AIS, Satellite Command and ADS-B history no longer leave dark panels and dark pop-ups on a light page.
- **ADS-B aircraft list**: each row's edge takes its altitude colour (as on the map); aircraft quiet for 20 s are faded; rows are a line shorter.
- **ADS-B on a phone**: pop-ups stack at the bottom instead of over the map.

### Fixed

- The map's top-left counter hid the zoom-in button on every map with it.
- The SDR device list ran past the edge of narrower sidebars (OOK).
- Change password showed "Operator: None" without a user name; the network monitor's links were default blue.

---

## [2.33.25] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- After an upgrade, a browser could run the new pages with the previous version's cached scripts and styles for up to a day ("GPS.setSkyView is not a function", "SpyStations.setView is not a function", unstyled controls). Every static asset URL now carries the app version, so each release is fetched fresh.
- On windows narrower than about 1420 px, the toolbar's More and Stop all buttons squeezed their labels ("Mo", "Sto al"); they now show icons only there.
- ADS-B and AIS range rings were drawn at 30% opacity, 1 px, and hard to see over satellite imagery; they are now clearly visible.
- On the ADS-B dashboard at up to about 1600 px wide, the control bar squeezed the Airband group into a column and stretched the other groups to match, leaving tall empty boxes; the bar now wraps onto a second row instead.

---

## [2.33.24] - 2026-09-25

Polish round 4.

### Changed

- **Sidebar status card** carries the mode's Start / Stop (it presses the mode's own button), so long sidebars need no scrolling.
- **Toolbar**: theme, settings, help and a labelled "Stop all" stay; display mode, network monitor, agents, voice alerts, cheat sheet, shortcuts and log out move to a labelled **More** menu.
- **Notification history**: a bell lists the pop-ups shown in this tab (the last 50, following you between pages), with a count of unseen ones.
- **Header**: aircraft, vessels, Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices in view as chips that open their mode; zeros are left out.
- **ADS-B and AIS maps**: a reception outline, the furthest contact heard in each 10° of bearing, built up across sessions per location ("Reach" toggle, and a reset).
- **Satellite Command**: every tracked satellite's passes over the next 24 hours on one timeline, bar height the peak elevation; click to select.
- **Spy Stations**: a table view, one row per station, alongside the cards.
- **Weather satellite**: decoded images grouped by pass (satellite, time, frequency, mode, count), with image sizes; the sidebar opens on the controls rather than "Getting Started" (in every mode, guide sections are no longer opened by default).
- **Meters**: cards side by side.
- **Readability**: muted and dim text, and the Enhanced tier's teal, now meet 4.5:1 contrast in both themes; 27 hard-coded near-black greys use the theme's colour; every page has a keyboard focus ring.
- **Loading placeholders** share one style: a small spinner and dim text.

### Fixed

- Meters read the meter number from `ID` only, so all SCM+ (`EndpointID`) and IDM (`ERTSerialNumber`) meters were merged into one "Unknown" card; rates from readings seconds apart were in the millions.
- `AppFeedback` was not on `window`, so checks for it failed; the main page's `showInfo` drew its own box instead of a toast.
- A WeFax scheduler test failed between 00:00 and 02:00 UTC.

---

## [2.33.23] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **WebSDR globe**: receivers are flat dots coloured by load (green under half their listener slots used, amber at half or more) instead of bars standing off the globe; latitude and longitude lines; the globe fills more of the panel. Your location is marked, the view opens on it, and choosing a receiver draws a path from you to it. Hovering a receiver in the list highlights it on the globe.
- **WebSDR list**: nearest first, with distance and direction, place and antenna, and listener slots as a bar; a summary line (receivers, free slots, nearest); search, and sort by nearest, most free or name.
- `GET /websdr/receivers` takes optional `lat` and `lon`, adding `distance_km` and `bearing` and sorting nearest first before the 100-receiver cap.

### Fixed

- WebSDR receiver names, places and antenna notes showed raw HTML and entities from the KiwiSDR directory.
- A receiver without a position was drawn at 0,0.

---

## [2.33.22] - 2026-09-24

Polish round 3.

### Changed

- **Light theme**: with the Enhanced interface tier (the default), the light theme left the sidebar, section headers, output panel, nav and many panels near-black. Enhanced-tier colour rules now apply only in the dark theme; panels set into the page use a new `--surface-sunken` colour that suits both themes; inline dark panel colours use the theme's. Scopes, waterfalls and maps stay dark as displays.
- **Sidebar**: a mode's description-only opening section folds behind an (i) on the status card, so the sidebar opens on a section you can set (17 modes).
- **Sidebar**: the red "Kill All Processes" button goes; it duplicated "Stop all running processes" (⊗) in the toolbar.
- **Bottom bar** (Recon, Mute, Auto-scroll, export, Clear) shows only for Pager, 433 MHz, Meters and OOK, the modes whose feed it acts on.
- **Waterfall**: an idle note explains what will appear and how to tune; the mode buttons wrap instead of clipping LSB.
- **WebSDR**: receivers load on first visit (the server caches the list for an hour).
- **ADS-B and AIS dashboards**: a trend line of the live count over the last 15 minutes.
- **Phone**: the welcome page lists modes first; the bottom bar is one row that scrolls sideways.

### Fixed

- Firefox showed white scrollbars on the dashboards, ADS-B history and network monitor.
- The WeFax sidebar status card sat below five sections.
- The light theme's active nav group had an invisible label.
- The Settings tabs left About alone on a second row.

---

## [2.33.21] - 2026-09-24

A second polish pass: cleaner, more consistent, and less space spent on nothing.

### Changed

- **Sidebar**: a status card at the top says, for the mode in view, whether it is running and for how long, and which SDR, frequency and gain it will use. Section headers get icons. The sections you open are remembered per mode; a mode you have not arranged opens its first section.
- **Header**: the Run State strip sits in the header row instead of taking a row of its own.
- **Signal bars** use the same colours everywhere.
- **Pop-ups**: the ADS-B dashboard's five differently styled banners (airband tools, aircraft database, readsb, DVB drivers, alerts) are now the app's toasts, top right, clear of the controls. The Agents page uses them too.
- **Welcome page**: a Live card shows what is running (each a link back to it), the SDRs attached and in use, and the last 24 hours of observations by source. Mode tiles whose decoder is running get a light.
- **System Health**: temperatures as a heat grid of tiles, RAM and swap as gauges, and CPU and RAM history lines.
- **TSCM**: a threat gauge (No data, Low, Elevated, High) leads the banner, with the counts as neutral tiles beside it. The sweep panels say whether the sweep is stopped, listening, or failed to start.
- **433 MHz**: the "Audio Waveform" was a sine wave synthesised from each packet's level; it is replaced by a plot of the packets over the last minute, each as tall as its level, coloured by SNR and labelled with its device, over the noise floor. The server no longer builds the waveform or sends `scope` events.
- **OOK**: the latest frame is drawn as a pulse train with its bytes beneath, and the panel shows while idle.
- **Morse** and **Meteor**: idle views show what they will show (a keyed "CQ" envelope; the odd faint meteor streak) instead of an empty box.
- **Mode timelines** (433 MHz, pager, TSCM) say "No activity in this window" on one line, instead of a large block repeating the empty state below.
- **ADS-B history**: sparklines on the Messages, Snapshots and Aircraft totals, and a Traffic strip of aircraft per hour. `GET /adsb/history/traffic` returns the per-bucket counts.
- **Radiosonde**: each sonde card has an ascent profile (temperature against altitude), and says Ascending, or Descending with the burst altitude.
- **BT Locate** and **drone detection** maps open on your location instead of the whole world, with a note until something is plotted.
- **Agents**: health rings (response time), what each agent is running, a compact header and summary line, and the register form folds away once there are agents.

### Fixed

- The live empty state stayed visible above items in lists that append (OOK's frame log).
- Selected toggles in OOK and Morse (PWM/PPM/Manchester, MSB/LSB, CW Tone) were black text on nothing: `--accent` was never defined.
- Firefox showed a white default scrollbar beside every scrolling panel on the main page.

---

## [2.33.20] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **Activity feed** (Intel > Activity):
  - **Source tiles** above the feed show each source's icon and count in the time window. Click one to hide or show that source.
  - **A timeline** of the whole window: stacked bars per minute, coloured by source, so bursts and quiet periods stand out. Hover a bar for its counts, or click it to show just that period.
  - **Rows** carry the source's icon, and signal strength as a small bar beside the dBm.
  - **A Map** toggle shows the sightings that carry a position (aircraft, vessels, APRS) as dots coloured by source.
  - `GET /observations/histogram` returns the per-source counts over time.

---

## [2.33.19] - 2026-09-24

A polish pass.

### Changed

- **The Wi-Fi radar matches the Bluetooth radar**: the same face (rings, bearing ticks, fading sweep), Strong / Medium / Weak bands instead of Close / Mid / Far, and the same colours. Its bands now use the list's signal thresholds, so a network the list shows as strong sits in the strong ring.
- **BT Locate steers by a signal gauge** instead of an estimated distance. The arc fills with the smoothed signal, the trend beneath reads STRONGER, WEAKER or STEADY, and a tick marks the best reading so far, which shows when the target has been passed. "Confidence: +/- N m" and its map circle, a formula over distance estimates, are replaced by the signal's spread in dB.
- **GPS has a sky plot**: centre overhead, edge the horizon, north up, satellites coloured by constellation and filled when used in the fix, with short trails. It needs neither WebGL nor the internet; the 3D globe is a toggle away.
- **Space weather gauges**: Kp on a 0-9 arc labelled by storm level, solar wind speed on an arc, and Bz as a bar either side of zero labelled by what it means. The X-ray chart marks each flare class once and tints the M and X bands.
- **Empty lists show when they are listening**: an icon and a headline (Listening, with a pulse; Stopped; Couldn't start) above the detail.
- **The Run State strip shows what is running** and the mode in view, with the idle modes folded behind "+N idle". A chip opens its mode.

---

## [2.33.18] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **Times follow your browser.** With no time zone chosen in Settings, times read US Eastern. They now use the browser's own zone and clock format. A zone you chose is kept.
- **ESRI World Imagery is the default map.** CARTO's dark tiles now carry an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark without a key. A map you chose is kept.
- **Locate is obvious and starts at once.** Every Bluetooth device and Wi-Fi network row has a Locate button, and pressing it starts locating; it used to wait for Start to be pressed again.
- **A polished Bluetooth radar**, labelled Strong / Medium / Weak rather than in metres, which signal strength cannot give. Bluetooth rows no longer show a distance for the same reason.

### Fixed

- **Stop could be slow or not stop at all** (pager, 433 MHz, ADS-B). Processes are now stopped together and waited for until gone, so the SDR is free when released. The pager's rtl_fm no longer blocks for two seconds on every stop. If a decoder survives, the page shows it running and points to Kill All; the ADS-B dashboard shows STOPPING while it works.
- **Bluetooth labelled most devices AirTags or Samsung SmartTags.** Samsung's company ID alone counted as a SmartTag, every Apple device away from its owner as an AirTag, and the COVID exposure-notification service as Find My. Apple's Find My status byte now decides between AirTag, AirPods and other accessories, and iPhones, iPads and Macs are not trackers.
- **Space weather was missing solar wind, Kp and flux data.** NOAA retired the solar wind feeds and changed the format of others; the new feeds are read, and flare probabilities show the latest days.
- **Waterfall clicks were tuned one after another.** Clicking faster than the SDR restarts now goes straight to the last frequency.
- **GPS waited silently on a gpsd with no receiver**, as the gpsd package starts one at boot. The detected receiver is now handed to gpsd, or the fix is named.
- **Satellite data downloads were blocked (403).** Every start fetched TLEs from CelesTrak, which blocks addresses that download too often. The schedule now survives restarts: at most daily, and never retried within two hours.

---

## [2.33.17] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **With two Wi-Fi tabs open, each showed only about half the live updates.** The tabs competed for events from one queue. Each tab now receives every event.

### Removed

- **Distance estimates from signal strength.** Signal tooltips and the signal assessment panel showed "Est. range: < 3 meters" and the like, worked out from RSSI alone. A single receiver cannot measure distance this way: the same reading comes from a weak transmitter nearby or a strong one behind a wall.

---

## [2.33.16] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **Alerts, recordings, MQTT and the activity feed depended on how many browser tabs were open.** Each decoded event was processed by every open SSE stream: with two tabs, alerts fired twice and MQTT messages went out twice; with none, nothing was alerted, recorded or published. Events are now processed once, when decoded, whether or not a page is open. This applies to every mode that streams through the shared fan-out, and to ADS-B, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

### Changed

- **If you relied on alerts or MQTT only while a page was open,** they now also run with no page open, for as long as the mode is running.

---

## [2.33.15] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Past TSCM sweeps are listed** (`GET /tscm/sweeps`) with what each detected, and the survey's sweep step shows them. Any completed sweep can be compared with the active baseline.

### Changed

- **The TSCM client report is a printable page** (`/tscm/report/print`). The "PDF" was plain text, saved by the panel with a `.pdf` name that no PDF reader opens. Print the page, or choose "Save as PDF" as the printer. The text version is at `/tscm/report/text`, and `/tscm/report/pdf` now leads to the printable page.

### Fixed

- **The TSCM report left out the baseline comparison and meeting windows.** The report generator supported both, but no route passed them. The report now compares the sweep with the baseline it ran against and summarises its meeting windows.
- **Meeting windows were compared with device sightings an hour out in summer time** (or by whatever the local UTC offset is), so devices seen during a meeting could be counted as outside it.
- **Drone detection reported "running" with no working source**, and used an RTL-SDR without claiming it. It now claims the SDR, starts only the sources that can run, lists those left out, and fails with the reasons when none can run. The source indicators now light.
- **SubGHz returned 409 Conflict for a missing HackRF tool.** It now returns a 400 naming the tool, with the install command for your platform.
- **Remote agents said "sensor not available (missing tools)"**, or showed a raw `[Errno 2]`. They now name the missing tools, with install advice.
- **TSCM signal descriptions read badly.** For example, "suggest may be ambient noise" and "may indicate indicates likely nearby source" now read "suggest ambient noise or a distant source" and "may indicate a nearby source".
- **AIS dashboard DSC messages** show elapsed time ("3 min ago") like every other list.

---

## [2.33.14] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Activity feed** (Intel > Activity). One reverse-chronological stream of sightings from every mode that reports them, colour-coded by source. Filter by source, time window (15 minutes to 24 hours) or a single device; pause to read without losing anything, since new sightings are held and shown on resume. A Bluetooth address the TSCM identity engine has grouped under MAC randomisation shows that grouping, labelled as the engine's judgement. The feed says what the data supports: sightings close together were seen in the same window, nothing more.
- **Observations.** A sighting is recorded as `{ts, source, identifier, entity, rssi, lat, lon, summary, raw}`. Every mode that already passed events through the event pipeline records them with no change of its own; 433 MHz and Wi-Fi record where their data is ingested, so they record whether or not a page is open. `GET /observations` filters by source, identifier (or resolved identity) and time window; `/observations/stream` tails them live; `/observations/stats` shows per-source counts and the policy below.
- **Volume and retention are part of it.** Each device is recorded at most once per interval (15 s for aircraft and vessels, 10 s for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, 5 s otherwise) and each source at 5 a second after a burst of 20, so a busy ADS-B feed cannot swamp the feed or the table. Writes are batched. Sightings older than 24 hours, and the oldest beyond 100,000, are deleted by the cleanup manager (`INTERCEPT_OBSERVATION_RETENTION_HOURS`, `INTERCEPT_OBSERVATION_MAX_ROWS`).

### Fixed

- **The test suite wrote to the real database.** Tests that did not set up their own now use a temporary one.
- **A WeFax scheduler test failed between about 12:20 and 13:00 UTC**, when its fixed broadcast time had already passed.

---

## [2.33.13] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Elapsed time in live lists.** Message, device and station times read "14 s ago" and stay current (one page-wide clock, once a second), with the exact time in your timezone on hover. Ten separate "ago" helpers, most refreshed every 10 or 30 seconds or never, now share one implementation.
- **Empty lists say why they are empty.** Each live list shows, while it has nothing in it, whether its decoder is running and for how long ("rtl_433 running · 0 readings in 4 s"), stopped, or why it last failed to start, naming the missing tool or busy device. Covers the shared feed, the sensor grid, APRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Meshtastic, OOK, drone, radiosonde, the image galleries, and the ADS-B, ACARS, AIS and DSC dashboard lists.
- **Copy buttons on identifiers**: ICAO hex, MMSI, MAC, BSSID and Meshtastic node ids.
- **Notes and tags on devices.** Attach a note and tags to any observed device; they are kept across restarts and shown wherever the device appears. A note does not mark a device known-good.

### Changed

- **Hidden tabs stop polling.** Clocks, countdowns and status polls pause while the tab is hidden. Measured on the main page in pager mode: 925 → 101 interval callbacks and 39 → 3 requests per minute. Data streams and recording are unaffected.
- **Install advice matches your platform.** Commands come from the dependency map for the package manager actually present, or the project's page when there is none; the 433 MHz mode no longer tells Linux users to use Homebrew.

### Fixed

- **Kill All could stop partway**, if OOK's cleanup failed, on an undefined name. Undefined-name checking is back on in `ruff`.

## [2.33.12] - 2026-09-24

A lifecycle contract now runs against every mode: start, stop and start again without restarting iNTERCEPT, with the tool missing, twice in a row, and with garbage on the decoder's output. These are what it found.

### Fixed

- **Stopping Morse or OOK could hang indefinitely.** Both closed the decoder's pipes before terminating it. `close()` waits for a reader thread blocked in `read()`, which only returns when the process exits, so the stop request never completed. The same happened to a Morse start whose first attempt received no samples. The process is now terminated first.
- **A pager start without `multimon-ng` left the SDR marked busy.** The device was claimed before the tool check and not released, so every later start of any mode on it failed with "device busy" until restart.
- **One corrupt byte ended the receiver waterfall.** `rtl_power` output was decoded strictly, and an invalid byte raised inside the read loop. The Bluetooth scanners (`hcitool`, `bluetoothctl`, Ubertooth) had the same weakness, and their output includes device names chosen by whoever owns the device, so any nearby device could stop a scan.
- **Drone detection could leave `rtl_433` running after stop.** A worker still starting when stop ran kept its process, holding the SDR.
- **Meshtastic with no USB device reported itself running**, and with more than one serial port the library called `sys.exit()`. The port is now chosen before connecting, with a clear error for none or several.
- **A missing tool gave a vague 500** in SSTV, general SSTV, WeFax, the receiver's audio and rtlamr ("Failed to start decoder"). They now return 400 naming the tool.
- **ADS-B returned HTTP 200 for a failed start** (device busy, dump1090 exiting), so the history page's start button never showed the failure.
- **Stopping ACARS, VDL2 or APRS when not running returned an error**; it is now a no-op, like every other mode.
- **Weather satellite needed a restart after installing SatDump**; a missing decoder is now checked again.

### Tests

- `tests/test_mode_lifecycle.py` applies the contract to every mode, and to the agent, faking decoders with real OS pipes so reader threads block as they do in production. Modes it cannot cover are listed with the reason.
- The suite now fails if peak memory passes 1 GB; a full run peaks near 350 MB. A 16 GB leak previously went unnoticed for months.

---

## [2.33.11] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **TSCM Survey workspace** (Intel > TSCM Survey). Most of the TSCM backend had no way in from the UI. One page now walks a survey in the order a practitioner works:
  1. **Baseline:** which baseline is active, when it was captured, its health (with the age and device count behind the score), and the others to activate.
  2. **Sweep:** the latest sweep, what each sweep type covers, and what it found that the baseline did not (new, missing and changed devices).
  3. **Known devices:** every device profiled this session with its score *and the indicators that make it up*, marking devices known or removing them, the known-device registry, and a lookup.
  4. **Threats and findings:** unresolved threats by severity, resolving them with notes, adding them to a case, case notes, high-interest devices with their playbook and timeline, and cross-protocol correlations.
  5. **Report:** the client report and JSON or CSV annexes for the latest sweep, with site, examiner and tiers.

  Sweeps and baseline recording stay in TSCM mode, which owns interface, SDR and agent selection; the workspace links there. Nothing on the page is derived from RSSI beyond the dBm reading itself: no distance, bearing, location or movement.

### Fixed

- **A TSCM baseline's age was wrong outside UTC.** It is stored in UTC and was compared with local time, so in the UK a baseline recorded a moment ago read as an hour old, and baselines aged into "noisy" and "stale" early.
- **Comparing a baseline with a sweep that had not finished failed with a server error.** It now says the sweep has no results yet, rather than reporting every baseline device as missing.

---

## [2.33.10] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **The TSCM client report states observations rather than labels derived from them.** Each finding's signal line now gives the measurements, for example `Signal: -48 dBm, observed for 80 minutes (40 sightings)`, in place of `Signal: Strong (Confidence: High)`. The "confidence" encoded only those three numbers but read to a client as confidence that a device was a bug.
- The **Assessment** line describes the pattern (`Pattern consistent with an Apple AirTag`), and the **Interpretation** line ("probable close proximity") is gone: signal strength alone cannot place a device.
- The **Risk Score** line is gone from the client report. It summed unrelated indicator scores, and the indicators themselves are listed under each finding.
- The **overall assessment** states what needs doing (`2 devices require investigation, 2 devices require review.`) instead of HIGH/ELEVATED/MODERATE, which were derived from a count: three trackers in an office read "HIGH, requiring immediate attention".
- The JSON and CSV technical annexes still carry the signal classification, interpretation and risk score for the practitioner.

### Fixed

- **A TSCM sweep that detected nothing was reported as clear.** With zero devices on every band the report read "OVERALL ASSESSMENT: LOW. No significant indicators of surveillance activity were detected", presenting a sweep whose equipment was not receiving as a clean room. It now reads INCONCLUSIVE and says why. An enabled Wi-Fi or Bluetooth band that detected no devices is listed first under the sweep's limitations, with a prompt to check the adapter; a quiet RF band can be genuine and is not flagged.
- **TSCM report findings all read "Signal: Minimal (Confidence: Low)".** The report looked for `rssi_mean`, `observation_count` and `observation_duration_seconds`, none of which a correlation-engine profile carries, so every finding was assessed from no data. It now uses the profile's `rssi_current`, `detection_count` and first/last-seen times.
- **The TSCM CSV annex listed every device as `informational` with risk score 0**, including high-interest ones, because device timelines carry no risk fields. Device rows now take risk level, score and indicators from the device's finding.
- **CSV annex cells could be read as spreadsheet formulas.** Bluetooth names are chosen by whoever owns the device; a name beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` now gets a leading apostrophe so Excel and LibreOffice treat it as text.
- **Generating a TSCM report for a running or aborted sweep failed with a server error** (the sweep has no results yet).
- **TSCM report sweep times were UTC shown as local time**, beside a "Generated" time that really is local, and a running sweep's duration was off by the UTC offset. Stored times are now converted to local time.
- A device profile with a null protocol no longer aborts report generation.
- The generated admin password file is now written beside the database rather than relative to the working directory, so running the test suite no longer overwrites a real `instance/.initial_password` (#288).

---

## [2.33.9] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Named SDR devices.** Settings > SDR lists each detected receiver with a display name, which then replaces the hardware name ("Generic RTL2832U", "Device 0") in every device selector. Useful where several dongles each have a dedicated antenna. Names are capped at 48 characters and may not contain control characters or any of `` < > " ' ` ``. Requested by @bob1234uk (#269).
- **Per-device PPM correction, default gain and bias-T.** Set once per receiver, applied on every start of any mode using it: pager, 433 MHz sensors, morse, OOK, ACARS, VDL2, rtlamr, APRS, DSC, radiosonde, waterfall and Meteor, plus ADS-B and AIS, whose RTL-SDR commands now carry the correction (`dump1090 --ppm`, `AIS-catcher -p`). A mode's own field wins when filled in; left blank, the device default applies. The PPM (and pager and sensor gain) fields now start blank for that reason (#238).
- Settings follow the dongle across replugs when it reports a unique serial number. Most RTL-SDRs ship with the factory serial `00000001`; those, and any serial two dongles share, are keyed by USB position instead, and the SDR tab says so. Give a dongle its own serial with `rtl_eeprom -s` to make its settings follow it.
- Remote agents apply the same defaults, read from the agent host's own settings, and now validate PPM and gain before starting a decoder.

### Fixed

- **rtlamr ignored PPM correction and could not connect.** The correction was passed to `rtl_tcp` as `-p`, which is its listen port; it is now `-P`.

---

## [2.33.8] - 2026-09-23

### Security

- **A password you did not choose must now be changed before the interface is usable.** Removing the shipped `admin` default in 2.33.6 closed the vulnerability, but an install seeded with a generated password could still be left on it indefinitely. Accounts seeded that way, and any existing install still using `admin`, are now flagged: login redirects to a change-password page and every other route is blocked until a new password is set. An explicitly configured `INTERCEPT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is treated as the operator's own choice and does not force a change.

### Added

- **Change Password page** at `/change-password`, reachable whether or not a change is required. Requires the current password, a minimum of 12 characters, and confirmation.

### Fixed

- **Logout now clears the whole session** rather than only the `logged_in` flag, so no state survives into the next session.

---

## [2.33.7] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- **Kill All Processes from any page** — the control previously lived only in the main dashboard's System panel, so it was unavailable from the ADS-B, AIS and satellite dashboards, history, network monitor and agents pages — exactly where you end up when troubleshooting. It is now in the global nav (and the mobile nav) on every page that carries it, styled as a destructive action and confirming before it fires. On the main dashboard it delegates to the existing handler so SDR reservations, run flags and SSE connections are still reset. Requested by @bob1234uk (#274).

---

## [2.33.6] - 2026-09-23

### Security

- **The `/controller/*` API required no authentication.** `app.py`'s global login gate deliberately skipped every path under `/controller/`, on the basis that those routes authenticated callers themselves. They did not: `routes/controller.py` contained no session or credential check of any kind. Anyone able to reach the port could list registered agents (including their API keys), register an agent pointing at any URL, delete agents, and use the command proxy to start or stop SDR modes on remote nodes. The blueprint now authenticates every route, accepting a session or — for agent push only — a valid API key.
- **Agent API keys were returned to clients.** `_row_to_agent()` serialised `api_key`, so every `GET /controller/agents` response carried the shared secret of every configured agent. Responses now carry `has_api_key` instead, and internal callers fetch the secret explicitly via `get_agent_api_key()`.
- **Agent push accepted unauthenticated data for keyless agents.** `/controller/api/ingest` only checked `X-API-Key` when the agent had one configured, so an agent registered without a key accepted a push from anybody. A key is now required, and compared in constant time.
- **WebSocket endpoints skipped authentication.** `/ws/*` was allowed through on the assumption that a page load had already authenticated the client, but a WebSocket client need not load a page, and these endpoints carry live RF and audio data. The session is now verified on the upgrade request.
- **The default admin password `admin` has been removed.** With no `INTERCEPT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set, first-run now generates a random password, logs it and writes it to `instance/.initial_password` — behaviour that already existed but was unreachable because of the default. Existing installs still using `admin` now log a prominent warning at startup.
- **Path traversal in `/offline/check-asset`.** The handler checked that a path began with `/static/vendor/` but never normalised it, so `/static/vendor/../../../etc/passwd` passed and its existence was reported. It leaked existence only, not contents. The path is now resolved and containment asserted, matching the pattern already used in `routes/recordings.py`.
- **A stale authentication exemption for audio streaming.** `app.py` exempted every path under `/listening/audio/` from the login gate. The blueprint was later renamed to `/receiver`, so the rule matched no route and the audio endpoints were in fact protected — but the exemption remained, ready to reopen a hole the moment a `/listening` route was added back. Removed, with a test asserting no route sits under an exempted prefix.
- **Session cookie and secret key hardening.** `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Lax` are now set explicitly rather than inherited from browser defaults, and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is set when TLS is configured. `instance/secret.key` is created with mode 0600.

### Changed

- **Remote agents must now have an API key to push data.** An agent registered without one will be refused by `/controller/api/ingest`. Set a key on each agent in Settings, and in the agent's own `controller_api_key` configuration.

---

## [2.33.5] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- **Meshtastic nodes did not always appear without a page reload** — the map and node list were only refreshed when an incoming packet's portnum contained `POSITION` or `NODEINFO`. A node first heard via any other packet type (telemetry, text message, routing) was recorded in the stats but never fetched into the node list, so it stayed off the map until the page was reloaded. The list now also refreshes the first time a previously unseen node is heard, whatever the packet type, still debounced to avoid repeated fetches. MeshCore was unaffected — it pushes each node over SSE straight to the sidebar and map. Reported by @bob1234uk (#261).

---

## [2.33.4] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- **ADS-B aircraft from a remote agent never cleared** — `intercept_agent.py` accumulated every aircraft it heard for the lifetime of the scan, with no expiry, and served the whole set on every dashboard poll. The dashboard stamps each arrival as freshly seen, so its own 60-second expiry could never fire and contacts stayed on the map until the mode was stopped. The agent now drops aircraft not heard within `MAX_AIRCRAFT_AGE_SECONDS` (5 minutes), the same TTL local mode already used, and reports an accurate live count. Local (non-agent) tracking was unaffected. Reported by @bob1234uk (#263).

---

## [2.33.3] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- **433MHz sensor unit selection** — new Units dropdown in the sensor panel, passed to rtl_433's `-C` flag: Metric (°C, km/h, mm), Imperial (°F, mph, in), or Native (whatever each device reports, the previous behaviour). Converting at the decoder rather than in the browser keeps logged and displayed values in agreement and covers wind, rain and pressure as well as temperature. Supported on remote agents too. Requested in #252.

### Changed
- **Sensor units now default to Metric.** Devices that previously reported °F will read °C after this update. Select "Native (as each device reports)" in the sensor panel to restore the old behaviour. The setting applies when the scan starts, so changing it requires stopping and restarting the sensor.

---

## [2.33.2] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- **DSC call types and distress labels were mislabelled** — `utils/dsc/constants.py` held a second, unverified copy of the ITU-R M.493 lookup tables that disagreed with the spec-verified tables in `decoder.py`. Format specifiers 112 and 120 were swapped, so a routine individual call was labelled `DISTRESS` and an actual distress alert was labelled `INDIVIDUAL` in the VHF DSC monitor. Nature-of-distress codes were shifted one position against the spec, mislabelling every nature (a sinking read as "listing", man overboard read as "piracy"). The telecommand table also mapped 111 to `TEST` where the spec assigns 118. All three tables now match the spec, unverified telecommand codes report `UNKNOWN (<code>)` rather than guessing, and the tests assert exact values instead of key membership. Reported by @jimarndt (#244).

---

## [2.33.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- **ACARS SIGILL in the amd64 Docker image** — `acarsdec` upstream hardcodes `-Ofast -march=native`, so the published amd64 binary was compiled for the build runner's CPU and contained AVX-512 instructions. Starting ACARS on any CPU without AVX-512 (e.g. Core i5-8500) crashed immediately with `Illegal instruction`. The container build now strips `-march=native` while keeping `-Ofast`. Same fix class as the SatDump build (#185); ARM64 images were unaffected. Thanks to @mitchross for the diagnosis (#246).

---

## [2.33.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **CARTO API key setting** — CARTO now watermarks raster tile requests that don't include an API key. Settings > Map Tiles has a new CARTO API Key field (shown whenever a CartoDB provider is selected) that appends a free key (no account needed, from carto.com/basemaps/apikey) to tile requests to remove the watermark.

### Fixed
- **CartoDB watermark flash on mode maps** — Drone, SSTV/ISS, MeshCore, Meshtastic, WebSDR, and Weather Satellite maps painted an instant, hardcoded, unkeyed CartoDB tile layer before upgrading to the configured provider. If Settings was already initialized elsewhere in the session, they now use the real configured (and potentially keyed) tile layer immediately instead.

## [2.32.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **ADS-B historical playback** — new Playback tab on the ADS-B history page. Loads time-bucketed snapshots from the Postgres history database and animates aircraft positions on a Leaflet map. Controls: configurable time window (15 min – 24 h), bucket step (10 s – 5 min), play/pause, speed multiplier (1×–20×), and a time scrubber. Requires the `history` Docker profile or `INTERCEPT_ADSB_HISTORY_ENABLED=true`. Backed by new `GET /adsb/history/playback` endpoint.

---

## [2.31.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **BladeRF support** — bladeRF 2.0 micro (47 MHz – 6 GHz) and bladeRF x40/x115 (300 MHz – 3.8 GHz) detected and usable via SoapyBladeRF. TX capable. Supports FM demod, ADS-B, ISM, AIS, and I/Q capture.
- **HydraSDR RFOne support** — Detected and usable via SoapyHydraSDR (24 MHz – 1800 MHz, RX only, 10 MHz instantaneous bandwidth). Supports FM demod, ADS-B, ISM, AIS, and I/Q capture.

---

## [2.30.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **APRS station export** — `GET /aprs/export?format=json|csv` downloads all currently tracked APRS stations, consistent with the existing WiFi/Bluetooth/AIS export pattern.
- **USRP support** — Ettus USRP devices (N200, B200, B210) are now detected and usable via the SoapyUHD bridge. FM demod, ADS-B, ISM, AIS, and I/Q capture all supported through the existing SoapySDR toolchain.
- **MQTT data export** — Optional MQTT publisher that broadcasts decoded events from every module to a configurable broker. Disabled by default; set `INTERCEPT_MQTT_BROKER` to enable. Topics follow the pattern `<prefix>/<module>/<event_type>` (e.g. `intercept/aprs/packet`). Configure with `INTERCEPT_MQTT_PORT`, `INTERCEPT_MQTT_USER`, `INTERCEPT_MQTT_PASSWORD`, `INTERCEPT_MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX`, `INTERCEPT_MQTT_RETAIN`.

---

## [2.29.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **TSCM sweep metadata** — Site/Location and Examiner name fields on the sweep config, embedded in the HTML and PDF/annex reports.
- **Mark Cleared** — dim and badge a device as cleared directly from the live sweep view; cleared devices are excluded from generated reports, and the executive summary shows a cleared-device count. Resets at the start of each new sweep.
- **Examiner Ignore List** — persist your own devices (phone, laptop, etc.) in `localStorage` so they're filtered from the live display and every report export. Sidebar section lists current entries with per-item removal and a clear-all button.
- **TSCM report category filter** — choose which risk categories (High Interest, Needs Review, Informational) to include in generated reports, across the HTML report, PDF, JSON annex, and CSV annex. Defaults to High Interest + Needs Review.

### Fixed
- **ADS-B history Postgres password ignored** — the local setup wizard wrote the database password under the wrong `.env` key (`INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_PASS` instead of `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_PASSWORD`), so a custom password set during setup was silently dropped and the app fell back to the default. Docker Compose also hardcoded the Postgres password instead of reading it from `.env`. Both now correctly honor `INTERCEPT_ADSB_DB_PASSWORD`.

---

## [2.28.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Signal ID** — Offline signal identification against a bundled 594-signal database (seeded from SigID Wiki via Artemis-DB). Match an unknown signal by frequency, bandwidth, and modulation; results are ranked 0–100 with match reasons and SigID Wiki links.
- **Signal ID modal** — Standalone overlay (`SignalIdModal`) accessible from a new "Signal ID" button in the global nav Intel group, and from a dedicated "Identify Signal" button in the waterfall sidebar. Pre-populates from the current waterfall frequency when opened from there; accepts manual entry from the nav.
- **`POST /signalid/match` route** — Scored matching API with 60-second in-process cache. Scores frequency centrality (40 pts), bandwidth match (30 pts), modulation match (20 pts), and region match (10 pts). Returns ranked matches with `match_reasons` annotations.
- **`bin/import_artemis.py`** — One-command database refresh script. Downloads the latest Artemis-DB tar (~300 MB), extracts it, and merges new signals into `data/signals.json`. Run with `python3 bin/import_artemis.py --download`.

---

## [2.27.0] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Two-window hang** — Opening the app in two browser tabs/windows caused it to become completely unresponsive. Root cause: HTTP/1.1 limits browsers to 6 connections per origin (shared across all tabs). VoiceAlerts was automatically opening 3 SSE streams per window on page load, so two windows produced 8 persistent connections and permanently blocked all regular HTTP requests. VoiceAlerts streams are now opt-in (disabled by default); users can enable them in settings.
- **Alert messages split between windows** — The `/alerts/stream` SSE endpoint read from a single queue, so two windows would each receive only half the alerts. Now uses `sse_stream_fanout` so every window gets every alert.
- **Bluetooth v2 stream split between windows** — Same single-queue issue in `/api/bluetooth/stream`. Fixed with fanout via `subscribe_fanout_queue`, preserving named SSE events (`device_update`, `scan_started`, etc.).
- **ICAO lookup cache unbounded growth** — `_looked_up_icaos` set was never evicted; capped at 50 000 entries with LRU eviction to prevent memory growth under sustained ADS-B load.
- **Concurrent ICAO clear race** — `popitem()` on the ICAO dict could raise `RuntimeError` if a clear happened concurrently; guarded with try/except.
- **Bluetooth tracker fingerprint stability** — Tracker signature scan was incorrectly resetting stability counters on unchanged payloads; now skips the scan when the BLE payload fingerprint is unchanged.

### Added
- **UI Tier system** — Three display modes selectable from the nav bar: *Lean* (minimal, no decorative elements), *Standard* (default), and *Enhanced* (full animations and ambient effects). Replaces the old animations toggle.
- **Display mode in first-run setup** — The first-run modal now includes a display mode selection step so new users can pick their preferred visual style during initial setup.

### Performance
- ADS-B SSE snapshot priming moved inside the response generator (avoids blocking before headers are sent).
- WiFi network filter combined into a single list pass instead of chained filters.
- Bluetooth tracker signature scan skips processing when the BLE payload fingerprint is unchanged.
- `DataStore` cleanup minimises lock hold time by collecting expired keys before acquiring the write lock.

---

## [2.26.11] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **APRS map ignores configured observer position** — The APRS map always fell back to the centre of the US (39.8°N, 98.6°W) when no live GPS fix was available, ignoring the observer position configured in `.env` (`INTERCEPT_DEFAULT_LAT` / `INTERCEPT_DEFAULT_LON`). Now seeds the APRS user location from the shared observer location on page load, so the map centres correctly and distance calculations work. (#193)

---

## [2.26.10] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **APRS stop timeout and inverted SDR device status** — The APRS stop endpoint terminated two processes sequentially (up to 4s) while the frontend timed out at 2.2s, causing console errors and the SDR status panel to show stale state (active after stop, idle during use). Now releases the SDR device immediately and terminates processes in a background thread so the response returns instantly. (#194)

---

## [2.26.9] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **ADS-B bias-t support for RTL-SDR Blog V4** — When dump1090 lacks native `--enable-biast` support, the system now falls back to `rtl_biast` (from RTL-SDR Blog drivers) to enable bias-t power before starting dump1090. The Blog V4's built-in LNA requires bias-t to receive ADS-B signals. (#195)

---

## [2.26.8] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **acarsdec build failure on macOS** — `HOST_NAME_MAX` is Linux-specific (`<limits.h>`) and undefined on macOS, causing 3 compile errors in `acarsdec.c`. Now patched with `#define HOST_NAME_MAX 255` before building. Also fixed deprecated `-Ofast` flag warning on all macOS architectures (was only patched for arm64). (#187)

---

## [2.26.7] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Health check SDR detection on macOS** — `timeout` (GNU coreutils) is not available on macOS, causing `rtl_test` to silently fail and report "No RTL-SDR device found" even when one is connected. Now tries `timeout`, then `gtimeout` (Homebrew coreutils), then falls back to a background process with manual kill. (#188)

---

## [2.26.6] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Oversized branded 'i' logo on dashboards** — `.logo span { display: inline }` in dashboard CSS had higher specificity (0,1,1) than `.brand-i { display: inline-block }` (0,1,0), forcing the branded "i" SVG to render as inline which ignores width/height. Added `.logo .brand-i` selector (0,2,0) to retain `inline-block` display. (#189)

---

## [2.26.5] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Database errors crash entire UI** — `get_setting()` now catches `sqlite3.OperationalError` and returns the default value instead of propagating the exception. Previously, if the database was inaccessible (e.g. root-owned `instance/` directory from running with `sudo`), the `inject_offline_settings` context processor would crash every page render with a 500 Internal Server Error. (#190)

---

## [2.26.4] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Environment Configurator crash** — `read_env_var()` crashed with "Setup failed at line 2333" when `.env` existed but didn't contain the variable being looked up. `grep` returned exit code 1 (no match), which `pipefail` propagated and `set -e` turned into a fatal error. Fixed by appending `|| true` to the pipeline. (#191)

---

## [2.26.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **SatDump AVX2 crash** — SatDump now compiles with `-march=x86-64` on x86_64 platforms (Docker and `setup.sh`), preventing "Illegal instruction" crashes on CPUs without AVX2. SIMD plugins still use runtime detection for acceleration on capable hardware. (#185)

---

## [2.26.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

---

## [2.22.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- Waterfall control panel rendered as unstyled text for up to 20 seconds on first visit — CSS is now loaded eagerly with the rest of the page assets
- WebSDR globe failed to render on first page load — initialization now waits for a layout frame before mounting the WebGL renderer, ensuring the container has non-zero dimensions
- Waterfall monitor audio took minutes to start — `_waitForPlayback` now only reports success on actual audio playback (`playing`/`timeupdate`), not from the WAV header alone (`loadeddata`/`canplay`)
- Waterfall monitor could not be stopped — `stopMonitor()` now pauses audio and updates the UI immediately instead of waiting for the backend stop request (which blocked for 1+ seconds during SDR process cleanup)
- Stopping the waterfall no longer shows a stale "WebSocket closed before ready" message — the `onclose` handler now detects intentional closes

---
